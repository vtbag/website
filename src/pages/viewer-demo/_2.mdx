You need to install the `link-types` script of the `@vtbag/turn-signal` package to make `data-vtbag-link-types` work. Here is a example how you embed the script after installing the package using `npm i @vtbag/turn-signal`:

```astro
---
import linkTypes from "@vtbag/turn-signal/link-types?url"
---
<html>
  <head>
    <script src={linkTypes}></script>
    ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

Details of embedding will depend on you bundler.
