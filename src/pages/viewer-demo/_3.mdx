With the script and the annotations in place you can use the generated view transition types to guard your animation rules:

```css
  :active-view-transition-type(next) {
    &::view-transition-old(.img) {
      animation: slide-out-left 0.5s ease-out;
    }
    &::view-transition-new(.img) {
      animation: slide-in-left 0.5s ease-out;
    }
  }
  :active-view-transition-type(same)::view-transition-image-pair(.img) {
    animation: blink 0.5s;
  }
  :active-view-transition-type(prev) {
    &::view-transition-old(.img) {
      animation: slide-out-right 0.5s ease-out;
    }
    &::view-transition-new(.img) {
      animation: slide-in-right 0.5s ease-out;
    }
  }
```
The definitions asume that all the images have the view tranition class `img`.
