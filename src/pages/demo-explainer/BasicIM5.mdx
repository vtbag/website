This example takes a rather unconventional approach. Instead of tweaking the old and new images until everything looks nice, it ignores them and sets a background image on the image pair pseudo element.
```diff lang="css"
    ::view-transition-image-pair(img) {
      background-image: url("/landscape.webp");
      background-position: center;
      background-size: cover;
    }
    ::view-transition-old(img),
    ::view-transition-new(img) {
      display: none;
    }
```
Be aware that this approach only works if the old and the new images have the same `object-fit` and `object-position`, which has to be mirrored by the corresponding `background-*` properties of the image pair pseudo.
