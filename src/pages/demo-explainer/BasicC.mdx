This example features an image carousel where each image is its own web page.

### HTML

The HTML structure is straight forward:

```html
<body>
  <h1>View Transition Example<br />Basic Cross-Document</h1>
  <p>...</p>
  <h2>My lovely picture</h2>
  <img
    id="image"
    width="400"
    height="400"
    src="/chamber.webp"
    alt="The Inspection Chamber"
  />
  <a class="nav-button right" href="/demo/BasicC2/">Next</a>
</body>
```

### View Transition specific CSS

The only code needed to enable view transitions for this example consists of a single `@view-transition` rule:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @view-transition {
    navigation: auto;
  }
}
```
It instructs the browser to do a cross-document transition. The @-rule has to be present on the old and the new page and both pages must share the same origin. Wrapping it in a media query respects the users who prefer reduced motion.

In this example, no specific view-transition-name properties are defined. Instead, the example relies on the default view transition name, `root`, which the browser automatically applies to the `<html>` element. This means that the old and new images are those of the viewport before and after the transition.
