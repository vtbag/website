The [previous example](/demo/BasicIM2/) demonstrated that the default styling for view transitions can force images to grow larger than the original old or new image dimensions before they fade out.

### Preventing Image Overflow
Preventing the old and new images from overflowing the group outline is straightforward. The group pseudo-element is the parent of the image pair, which in turn is the parent of the image pseudo-elements. Simply setting the overflow property on the group pseudo-element will take care of it.

```css ins={1-3}
    ::view-transition-group(img) {
      overflow: clip;
    }
```

Now the images will be cut off when they extend beyond the boundaries of the transition group. Admittedly, cutting the face in half isn't visually appealing.

### Further Improvement: Prefer Height Over Width
In this example it looks better when we also change [the default behavior of morph transitions](/basics/default-animations/#how-the-boxes-morph) from all images being _full group width_ to _full group height_. Now, the landscape image grows in from the left, creating a nice reveal effect. Adding `right: 0` keeps the face aligned with the right edge as it fades.

```css ins={1-6}
    ::view-transition-old(img),
    ::view-transition-new(img) {
      block-size: 100%;
      inline-size: auto;
      right: 0;
    }
```

### More Options
There are more options if you want to tweak the standard morph behavior. Here are some of the knobs you might want to turn:
* inline-size and block-size, width and height: see above
* z-index: The view transition API places the new image above the old one. You can change this by assigning the old image an appropriate z-index value.
* opacity: As an alternative to the default cross-fade, you could only fade-out the upper image.
* animation-name: if you don't need the fade, or want to define your own `mix-blend-mode` value you can set the `animation-name` to `none`
* animation: if you want a different fade or even a different effect like shrinking or rotating
* mix-blend-mode: when you canceled the default animation
* object-fit: see [next example](/demo/BasicIM4/)
* padding, borders, transforms,&hellip;



## Inspection Chamber Insights

Here are the detailed pictures as seen with the inspection chamber.

<div style="display:flex">
<span id="mix1">![Animation details](_IM3-1-both.png)</span>
<span id="mix2">![Animation details](_IM3-2-both.png)</span>
</div>

The left one shows the effect of just setting `overflow: clip`. The right one also has the `height` (`block-size`) set to 100% and the `width` (`inline-size`) to `auto` to keep the aspect ratio.

While this is in my opinion already better than the last one, I'll show you my favorite in the [next example](/demo/BasicIM4/).
