The [previous example](/demo/BasicIM2/) demonstrated that the default styling for view transitions can force images to grow larger than the original old or new image dimensions before they fade out.

### Preventing Image Overflow
Preventing the old and new images from overflowing the group outline is straightforward. The group pseudo-element is the parent of the image pair, which in turn is the parent of the image pseudo-elements. Simply setting the overflow property on the group pseudo-element will take care of it.

```css ins={1-3}
    ::view-transition-group(img) {
      overflow: clip;
    }
```

Now the images will be cut off when they extend beyond the boundaries of the transition group. Admittedly, cutting the face in half isn't visually appealing. In this examples it looks better when we change the default from all images being full group width to full group height. Now, the landscape image grows in from the left, creating a nice reveal effect. Adding `right: 0` keeps the face aligned with the right edge as it fades.

```css ins={1-6}
    ::view-transition-old(img),
    ::view-transition-new(img) {
      block-size: 100%;
      inline-size: auto;
      right: 0;
    }
```

### More Options
There are more options if you want to tweak the standard morph behavior. Here are some of the knobs you might want to turn:
* inline-size and block-size, width and height: see above
* z-index: The view transition API places the new image above the old one. You can change this by assigning the old image an appropriate z-index value.
* opacity: As an alternative to the default cross-fade, you could only fade-out the upper image.
* animation-name: if you don't need the fade, or want to define your own `mix-blend-mode` value you can set the `animation-name` to `none`
* animation: if you want a different fade or even a different effect like shrinking or rotating
* mix-blend-mode: when you canceled the default animation
* object-fit: see [next example](/demo/BasicIM4/)
* padding, borders, transforms, &hellip;



## Inspection Chamber Insights

Here are the detailed pictures as seen with the inspection chamber.

<div style="display:flex">
<span id="mix1">![Animation details](_IM3-1-both.png)</span>
<span id="mix2">![Animation details](_IM3-2-both.png)</span>
</div>

The left one shows the effect of just setting `overflow: clip`. The right one also has the `height` (`block-size`) set to 100% and the `width` (`inline-size`) to `auto` to keep the aspect ratio.

While this is in my opinion already better than the last one, I'll show you my favorite in the [next example](/demo/BasicIM4/).
