Bump your view transition images into position to avoid that unexpected pseudo-smooth-scrolling.

The Cam-Shaft is about an issue we already resolved for Astro's ViewTransitions (see [here](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/starlight/inner-workings/transitions/#the-pseudo-scrolling-main-area) and [here](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/library/PageOffset/)), but it still requires support for browser-native cross-document view transitions.

## PREREQUISITE

:::tip[View Transition API]
The Camshaft is designed to address an issue with browser-native cross-document view transitions. In browsers that haven't implemented the API yet, it simply does nothing, as there's no problem to solve.
:::


## What is it?

This tools is intended to avoid the [pseudo-smooth-scroll effect](/tips/pseudo-smooth-scrolling/).

See the [interactive demo of the effect](/shaft-demo/1/) and the [interactive demo of the solution using the cam-shaft](/shaft-demo2/1/).


## Installation
:::tip
If you want to use the Cam-Shaft with an Astro project, see [astro-vtbot](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/library/CamShaft/) for reusable components you can easily use in your project.
:::

To use the Cam-Shaft, you can install the npm package in your project. Alternatively you can load the script from one of the global content delivery networks that provide npm packages.

<Steps>
1. Install `@vtbag/cam-shaft from npm
2. In your project, add `@vtbag/cam-shaft/index.js` as an inline script at the beginning of the `<head>` element on all pages of your site.
</Steps>

Details depend on your project setup and the frameworks used, but with a bundler like `vite` it can be as simple as:

```jsx
import shaft from "@vtbag/cam-shaft?url";
<html>
  <head>
    <script src={shaft} />
    ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

## Configuration and Usage

The Cam-Shaft script needs to know which view transition name's images it should bump and nudge. By default, it assumes it should handle `::view-transition-group(main)`.

If you need to target a different view transition name, you can use the `data-view-transition-names` attribute in the script tag. For example, the following will instruct the script to handle images for `::view-transition-group(content)`:

```html
<script src=... data-view-transition-names="content"/>
```

As you may have guessed from the plural form, you can specify multiple view transition names by separating them with spaces, allowing the script to manage several groups.
