Pick the tools you need to craft the view transitions you want!

The Utensil Drawer is a collection of scripts and functions that might come in handy when programming view transitions.

Some functions are meant to be imported into your own scripts, while others can be used directly as scripts on websites. For the latter, the Utensil Drawer also provides bundled, ready-to-use versions.

## What is it?

One day, when it grows up, this will be an eclectic collection of snippets for various purposes. The `@vtbag/utensil-drawer` package are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vtbag/utensil-drawer).

## Declarative Names

The `@vtbag/utensil-drawer/declarative-names` script assigns view transition names to HTML elements. This [comes in handy](/tips/auto-names/) if you want to assign names to many elements like all images in a container or all items in a list.

The Utensil-Drawer offers a bundled script for cross-document view transitions and reusable function for same-document view transitions.

This functionality is similar to assigning dynamic view transition names with the `auto` value, but it works consistently across browsers and gives you greater control. You specify the names to assign. This allows you to match elements between the old and new pages for cross-document morph animations, which is something not possible with dynamically generated names from `view-transition-name: auto`.

### Script Usage

For use with cross-document view transitions you load the `declarative-names.js` script on every page that needs declarative view transition names and specify what names to assign where with the `data-vtbag-decl` attribute.

```jsx
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <script src="/declarative-names.js" data-vtbag-decl="..."/>
  </head>
```

To ensure that the code is executed before the `pagereveal` event, the script must be placed inside the `<head>` element of your page as a classical inline script. Do _not_ add `type="module"` or the `defer` or `async` attributes as this would delay the script too much.

### Reusable Functions

The reusable functions can be imported from `@vtbag/utensil-drawer/set-view-transition-names`.

```ts
import { setSelectedViewTransitionNames } from "@vtbag/utensil-drawer/set-view-transition-names";

setSelectedViewTransitionNames("h2", "headers-");
```

For details see the comments in the [code](http://github.com/vtbag/utensil-drawer/blob/main/src/set-view-transition-names.ts)

### Examples

This site uses the `declarative-names` script for cross-document navigation to make `h2` and `h3` headings standout when navigating through the pages. It also randomizes the entries of the table of contents visible in the right part of the screen in the desktop view. Here is the configuration used for this:

```apl
data-vtbag-decl="h2, h3 = vtbag-h-; starlight-toc span = vtbag-toc~"
```

This assigns `vtbag-h-0, ...` to the h2 and h3 headers of every page. This makes headings appear to lift off the page during navigation and smoothly slide into place on the next page.

The second declaration assigns `vtbag-toc-0, ...` in a random fashion to the entries of the page navigation bar: During navigation, the entries swirl into place, seamlessly adjusting to the new structure.

### Configuration

You instruct the script with a `data-vtbag-decl` attribute on a script element. Typically on the very script element that loads the `declarative-names` code, but any other script element found in the DOM when the script executes will do. You can use this to your advantage to compose the declarations from multiple sources, but make sure that those elements a positioned before the `declarative-names` script.

The structure for the declaration is as shown in the syntax diagram:

</div>

The data attribute accepts a semicolon separated list of rules.
A rule tells the script to add a `view-transition-name`, starting with the given `prefix`, to the `style` attribute of all DOM elements matching the `css-selector`. If the rule ends right after the selector, it implicitly uses `vtbag-decl-{i}-` for some _i_ as the prefix. Prefixes can consist of arbitrary characters but must not contain semicolons `(;)` or equal signs `(=)`. Selectors can be any valid CSS selector, but can't contain semicolons and ASCII characters other than `A-Za-z0-9_-` must be escaped.

To ensure unique view transition names, a numeric suffix is appended to the prefix when a rule applies to multiple elements, unless the prefix is empty, `none`, or `auto`. The numbering starts at 0 and increments by 1, following the order in which elements appear in the DOM. If the prefix ends with `~`, the `~` is replaced with `-`, and numbers are assigned in a randomized manner instead of sequentially.

If an element’s style attribute already contains a view-transition-name, it will be overridden unless the rule uses the weak assignment operator `~=`.

## escapeViewTransitionName()

The `escapeViewtransitionName()` function [escapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/custom-ident) characters in a string, making it safe to use as a view transition name.

```ts
import { escapeViewTransitionName } from "@vtbag/utensil-drawer/escape-view-transition-name";

const escaped = escapeViewTransitionName("my:ident"); // => my\:ident
```

:::note
In client-side code, you can use `CSS.escape()` to escape custom identifiers.

The `escapeViewTransitionName()` function might come in handy for server-side environments, where a CSS object isn't available.

## Morphing Vector

_experimental_

In most cases, you know your page layout and can predict where elements with view transition names are positioned and how they will animate during a transition. But sometimes, you do not have that static knowledge—element positions may vary dynamically. Wouldn't it be useful if animations could adapt based on the positions of those elements, or even react to the distance and angle between the old and new images sharing the same view transition name?

That's where the `setVectors()` function comes in:

Assume `::view-transition-group(<group>)` having _width1_, _height1_ morphs form _(x1, y1)_, to _(x2, y2)_ having _width2_, _height2_. Calling `setVectors()` when the view transitions `ready` promise fulfills, adds the following CSS definitions to your page:

```css
:root {
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-from-x: ${x1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-to-x: ${x2}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-from-y: ${y1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-to-y: ${y2}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-from-width: ${width1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-to-width: ${width2}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-from-height: ${height1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-${group}-to-height: ${height2}px;
}
::view-transition-group(${group}) {
  --vtbag-vector-from-x: ${x1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-to-x: ${x2}px;
  --vtbag-vector-from-y: ${y1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-to-y: ${y2}px;
  --vtbag-vector-from-width: ${width1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-to-width: ${width2}px;
  --vtbag-vector-from-height: ${height1}px;
  --vtbag-vector-to-height: ${height2}px;
}
```

This way you can access the parameters of the morph animations directly within you CSS rules.

### Usage

Here is an example from the [Derived Trajectories Demo](/vector-demo/): `setVector` is called right at the beginning of the animation phase when all old and new images are setup.
```js
import { setVectors } from "@vtbag/utensil-drawer/vectors";
...
document.startViewTransition(...).ready.then(() => setVectors())
```
This adds the `--vtbag-vector-*` custom properties to the page as shown in the last section. Of course, this also works with [`mayStartViewTransition()`](#maystartviewtransition).

CSS rules can now access the values and calculate derived parameters for the animations.

```css
  ::view-transition-image-pair(.el) {
    animation-name: arc;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  }
  @keyframes arc {
    50% {
      transform: translateX(
        calc(var(--vtbag-vector-to-y) / 3 - var(--vtbag-vector-from-y) / 3)
      );
    }
  }
```


Since we are using a view-transition-class in the selector, this CSS rule applies animations to multiple pseudo-elements. Each image pair gets its own version of the keyframe definition, inheriting the custom-property values from its parent, the `::view-transition-group` pseudo-element. The `var()` expressions are evaluated once when the keyframes are defined. Changing the values of the custom properties later will not affect the keyframes or the animations.

### Configuration

By default, `setVectors()` will do this for every morph animation, i.e. for every view transition group that holds both, the old and the new image.

To optimize the size of the generated CSS for the custom-properties, the `setVectors()` function accepts two parameters:

```ts
setVectors(instructions: Inst[], where: "root" | "pseudo" | "both" = "both")
```

The `instructions` parameter can be used to exclude groups and properties. Each instruction has a regular expression that selects group names, and an array of property names. An instruction tells the function to set pseudo properties for the given property names if the regular expression completely matches the group name.

The default instructions are `[{pattern: ".*", props: ["x", "y", "width", "height"]}]`. This adds properties for x, y, width, and height to all groups. If you, for example, only want custom-properties for _x_ and _y_ for groups where the name starts with `elt-`, use `[{pattern: "elt-.*", props: [x, y]}]`.

The `where` parameter tells the function whether the pseudo properties should be added to the `::view-transition-group` pseudo, to the `:root` element, or to both.

## Type Declarations

_experimental_

Copy [`dom-view-transitions-level2.d.ts`](http://github.com/vtbag/utensil-drawer/blob/main/src/dom-view-transitions-level2.d.ts) to your `src` directory if you are missing declarations for the new types and interfaces.

```ts
declare global {
  type UpdateCallback = undefined | (() => void | Promise<void>);
  type StartViewTransitionParameter = {
    types?: string[] | Set<string>;
    update?: UpdateCallback;
  };

  interface Document {
    startViewTransition?(
      param?: StartViewTransitionParameter | UpdateCallback
    ): ViewTransition;
  }
  interface PageSwapEvent extends Event {
    viewTransition?: ViewTransition;
    activation?: NavigationActivation;
  }
  interface PageRevealEvent extends Event {
    viewTransition?: ViewTransition;
  }

  interface WindowEventMap {
    pageswap: PageSwapEvent;
    pagereveal: PageRevealEvent;
  }

  interface NavigationActivation {
    entry: NavigationHistoryEntry;
    from: NavigationHistoryEntry;
    navigationType: NavigationTypeString;
  }
  interface AnimationEffect {
    target: HTMLElement;
    pseudoElement?: string;
    getKeyframes: () => Keyframe[];
  }

  interface ViewTransition {
    types?: Set<string>;
  }
  interface Window {
    navigation?: Navigation;
  }
  interface Navigation {
    activation: NavigationActivation;
  }
}
export {};
```

## mayStartViewTransition()

_experimental_

More than just a wrapper. This function upgrades your view transitions with advanced capabilities and seamless fallbacks.

This function provides quite different functionalities.
1. It wraps `document.startViewTransition()` to free you free you from checking whether the browser supports the View Transition API. You can call it the same way in any browser, whether it supports Level 2, Level 1, or nothing at all.
2. It includes built-in support for users who prefer reduced motion, automatically suppressing transitions based on system or browser settings.

3. The View Transition API cancels active view transitions when a new one starts. `mayStartViewTransition` provides alternatives to prevent these cancellations. Here is what's supported:

    * If the animations have not started yet, the function can automatically merge additional update callbacks into the current view transition. This means multiple UI components can trigger transitions close together, and they will seamlessly act as one.

    * If animations are already in progress, the function queues new update  callbacks and runs them once the current view transitions finishes, combining them into a single update function for a new view transition.

    * It can also skip starting a new transition if one is already running, letting the active one take the lead for a smoother result.

In the simplest use case, `mayStartViewTransition` works as a drop-in replacement for `document.startViewTransition`. Like the Level 2 API, it accepts either an update callback or an options object with a callback and view transition types. If the browser only supports the old syntax with the callback, the parameters are mapped accordingly. Types are lost in this case.

When the View Transition API is not supported at all, `mayStartViewTransition()` falls back gracefully by calling the update function directly and returning a compatible object with `updateCallbackDone`, `ready` and `finished` promises.

You can also pass a second options parameter for advanced behavior not available in the native API:

```js
export interface StartViewTransitionExtensions {
	respectReducedMotion?: boolean; // default is true
	collisionBehavior?: 'skipOld' | 'chaining' | 'skipNew' | 'never'; // default is "skipOld"
	speedUpWhenChained?: number; // default is 1.0
	maxUpdateDuration?: number; // default is 250 (milliseconds)
}
```
### Basic Chaining Examples

`mayStartViewTransition` is useful when you need to manage concurrent calls to `startViewTransition`. Common use cases include debouncing transitions triggered by user events, or allowing UI components to start view transitions independently, without requiring them to coordinate or be manually integrated into a single transition.

##### Debouncing

The [Derived Trajectories](/vector-demo/) demo uses `mayStartViewTransitions` to ensure that rapid clicks triggering element shuffles do not cancel the current view transition animation.

```js
button.addEventListener('click', (e)=>{
  mayStartViewTransition(shuffle, {
    collisionBehavior: "chaining"
  })
});
```
If the user clicked several times during the animation, `mayStartViewTransition` queues the shuffle callbacks and executes them together in a single update function for a subsequent view transition.

The [Game of Life](/chaining-demo/) uses the same technique to decouple the calculation of new generations from their rendering. If generations are requested faster than the view transition can display them, `mayStartViewTransition`  automatically queues the update callbacks. You can quickly fill the queue on desktop by "clicking" the NEXT button using the keyboard auto-repeat. You should then see the queued request processed in batches. Visually, life proceeds skipping several generations at a time.


##### Automatic Integration
The [Tower of Hanoi](https://fun-with-view-transitions.pages.dev/episode/7/page.html) demo (to be soon covered by a new episode of Fun with View Transitions) makes multiple independent calls to `mayStartViewTransition`. One animates the  disk movements, another updates the progress bar and counters. A separate view transition runs when the puzzle is solved, and yet another handles switching between light and dark mode.


These transitions are conceptually and technically independent. Some share the same trigger, but not all. From the user's perspective, the result appears as a single coordinated transition, even though there is no shared or global app code managing synchronization.

```js title="ProgressContainer"
mayStartViewTransition(updateProgress, {collisionBehavior: "chaining"})
```
```js title="MoveDisks"
mayStartViewTransition(moveDisks, {collisionBehavior: "chaining"})
```


Assume the `ProgressContainer` code runs before the `MoveDisk` code. `ProgressContainer` starts a view transition.  Program execution continues normally while the View Transition API begins capturing old images, and then calls the update callback.

If  `MoveDisk` calls `mayStartViewTransition` before the API is ready to capture the new images, `mayStartViewTransition` can automatically extend the active update callback to include `MoveDisk`'s update callback. This mechanism also supports more than two calls.

#### Current View Transition
The module also exports `getCurrentViewTransition()` to access the active global view transition object. Iff the function returns undefined, no view transition is currently active.


### respectReducedMotion
When `respectReducedMotion` is enabled, `mayStartViewTransition` behaves as if native view transitions are not supported if the user has turned on reduced motion at the operation system or browser level.

### collisionBehavior: "chaining"
When `collisionBehavior` is set to `"chaining"`, calls to `mayStartViewTransition` do not interrupt active view transitions.

Instead, if the animation has not yet started, the updates are merged into the current transition.
If the animation is already in progress, updates from new calls are queued and played back in a new view transition that begins automatically once the current one has finished.


You can control how many work is done when replaying queued updates. By default, execution of queued updates stops after 250 milliseconds, and a new view transition begins. Remaining updates are applied in additional transitions. This results in a batched execution, with one or more updates grouped per added view transition.

##### maxUpdateDuration
If you assign a larger value to `maxUpdateDuration`, be aware that browsers may get impatient and skip view transitions with long combined update functions. Chromium, for example, appears to have a 4 second limit.

##### speedUpWhenChained
Triggering a new call during an ongoing transition can also be used to speed up the current animation if `speedUpWhenChained` is set to a value greater than 1.

### collisionBehavior: skipNew
Setting `collisionBehavior` to `skipNew` means a new view transition will only start if none is currently active. Otherwise, the update callback is executed immediately as if view transitions weren't supported and without affecting the ongoing view transition.

### collisionBehavior: skipOld
Setting `collisionBehavior` to `skipOld` give you the default behavior of view transitions, where new transitions cancel active ones.

### collisionBehavior: never
Setting `collisionBehavior` to `never` prevents any collisions by executing only the update callback, skipping pseudo-element creation and animation.
