Backward/forward view transitions for intuitive history navigation.

The Turn-Signal is a lightweight script for purely progressive enhancement of cross-document view transitions.  It detects the direction of browser navigation and signal it with view transition types or html attributes to guide directional styling. This enables developers to create smooth, responsive transitions that adjust based on forward or backward navigation, delivering a more intuitive user experience.

## PREREQUISITE

:::danger[Dependency on View Transition API]
The Turn-Signal is designed for use with cross-document view transitions. It depends on the Navigation API and make the assumption that all browsers that support level 2 of the View Transition API also support the Navigation API.

## Demo

import { Card } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

  <Card title="Turn-Signal Demo">

## Installation
:::tip
If you want to use the TurnSignal with an Astro project, see [astro-vtbot](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/library/TurnSignal/) for reusable components you can easily use in your project.
:::

To use the Turn-Signal, you can install the npm package in your project. Alternatively you can load the script from one of the global content delivery networks that provide npm packages.

<Steps>
1. Install `@vtbag/turn-signal` from npm.
2. In your project, add `@vtbag/turn-signal/index.js` as an inline script at the beginning of the `<head>` element on all pages of your site.
</Steps>

Details depend on your project setup and the frameworks used, but with a bundler like `vite` it can be as simple as:

```jsx
import signal from "@vtbag/turn-signal?url";
<html>
  <head>
    <script src={signal} />
    ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

### Forced Traversal

`@vtbag/turn-signal` also defines a second script that can be used with the main functionality or independent of it: It is called `forced-traversal` and replaces forward navigation with history traversals if the target pages has been visited before.

Users may be annoyed when a website messes up their history entries, but there are situations where replacing navigation with traversals has its appeal.  Use at your own discretion.

The `forced-traversal` feature is not covered by the example above. But the there is another demo on the [astro-vtbot-website](https://events-3bg.page.dev/signal-demo/forcedTraversal/blog/) that demonstrates the replacement.

Use this script in the same way as the main script by inserting it inside the `<head>`.
```jsx
import forcedTraversal from "@vtbag/turn-signal/forced-traversal?url"
...
  <script src={forceTraversal} />
</head>
```
There are no configuration options and the `forced-traversal` script does not take any parameters.

## Configuration and Usage

`@vtbag/turn-signal` main script accepts several config options. Those are specified as `data-*` attributes on the `<script>` element. They are all optional.

If used without any explicit parameters, the Turn-Signal
* sets the `backward` view transition type if it detects backwards history traversals.
* For navigation to the current page, it sets a view transition type called `same`.
* For all other navigation, the `forward` type is set.

If you want to tell the script about the order of the pages on your site, use the `data-selector` attribute to select links to all pages using CSS selectors. This site uses
```html
<script ... data-selector="header a, nav.sidebar li a"></script>
```
Here the first CSS selector selects the home page and the second all pages from the global site navigation. This selector will fit for all Starlight sites.

For a detailed description of `data-selector` and on how to instruct Turn-Style to set different types or even set attributes on the root element, see the [config options](/config/options/) below.

Let's see how you can use these view transition types to style different animations dependent on the direction of the navigation or even switch transition groups on and off.


### CSS for Reverse Animation

Chances are more often then not that you can not simply revert the direction of your animation for the `backward` effect. Assume you have `slideOutToLeft` for the old image and `slideInFromRight` for the new image.

```css title="Example for forward animations"
  ::view-transition-old(main) {
    animation-name: slideOutToLeft;
  }
  ::view-transition-new(main) {
    animation-name: slideInFromRight;
  }

  @keyframes slideOutToLeft {
    to {
      transform: translateX(-100%);
    }
  }
  @keyframes slideInFromRight {
    from {
      transform: translateX(100%);
    }
  }
```
Just changing the direction of the animations would lead to something best named `slideInFromLeft` for the old image and `slideOutToRight` for the new image. While the animations are about right, just setting `animation-direction: reverse` would apply them to the wrong images. You do not want to slide in the old image or slide out the new image. So better you swap the keyframes, too &hellip;

```css title="Example for fitting backward animations"
  :active-view-transition-type(backward) {
    &::view-transition-old(main) {
      animation-name: slideInFromRight;
      animation-direction: reverse;
    }
    &::view-transition-new(main) {
      animation-name: slideOutToLeft;
      animation-direction: reverse;
    }
  }
```
&hellip; or even explicitly define keyframes for `slideOutToRight` and `slideInFromLeft` if you feel that is clearer.

&hellip; and you can also define different animations for `:active-view-transition-type(same)`, i.e. for links to the current page, e.g. in a navigation bar by using the same pattern.

### Switching Transition Names

Transition types and direction attributes are determined on the old page and the new page of the cross-document view transition. Even though CSS for animating cross-document view transitions is [always taken from the new page](/tips/css/#animations), there is an important use case for directions on the old page: You can exclude elements from view transitions depending on the direction. With directions on the old page you can not only exclude new images but also old images!

```css title="How to switch off a view transition group based on direction"
main {
  view-transition-name: main; /* for forward and backward slides */
}

:active-view-transition-type(same) main {
  view-transition-name: none; /* but no transition for links to the same page */
}
```

The Turn-Signal also always sets view transition type `old` on the old page and `new` on the new page. So you can be even more specific:

```css title="How to switch off the old image, only"
:active-view-transition-type(same):active-view-transition-type(old) main {
  view-transition-name: none; /* but only a new image for links to the same page */
}
```


### Config Options
|Config option|Type|Effect|
|--|--|--|
|data-selector|a CSS selector|<p>If your site has a concept of _previous_ and _next_ page, use this to tell the Turn-Signal about your pages and their order. One selector _to find them all_.</p><p>The selector should return one element per page of your site, and each element must have an href attribute. Typically, you would select `<a>` elements from your navigation bar, such as `data-selector="nav a"`.</p><p>If your site doesn't already have a suitable structure, consider generating a list of pages in a non-intrusive way. For example, you could use `<a>` elements inside a `<template>` element or `<link>` elements with a custom `rel` attribute.</p><p> The sequence of selected URLs is used to derive the navigation direction. Navigation to a page that comes later in the sequence of selected URLs will be a _forward_ navigation. Navigation to a page that comes earlier in the sequence of selected URLs will be a _backward_ navigation.</p>|
|data-direction-types|backward-value, same-value, forward-value|<p>The Turn-Signal sets view transition types to convey the derived direction in a form that can easily be used for styling your animations.</p><p>By default, the types are `backward`, `same`, and `forward`, i.e. as if set using `data-direction-types="backward, same, forward"`. </p><p>An alternative would be `data-direction-types="reverse,,"` This would do nothing for same page and forward navigation, but would set the `reverse` type on backward navigation.</p><p>On the old page, the Turn-Signal also sets a type called `old` and on the new page it sets a type called `new`. This behavior can not be customized.</p>
|data-direction-attribute|attribute-name, backward-value, same-value, forward-value|<p>For compatibility with existing code you might want to use attributes rather than view transition types to select different styling for your animations.</p><p>You can specify what attribute to use and what values to set. Here is an example of how to make Turn-Signal directions compatible with the CSS Astro generates for `transition:animate`: `data-direction-attribute="data-astro-transition, back, forward, forward"`.</p>
