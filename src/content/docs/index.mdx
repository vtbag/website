<Card title="The Basics" icon="open-book">
Everything you ever wanted to know about the View Transition API, in one place.
Explore what your browser is capable of and what is new in the API specification.

Dive into examples and see what holds the world of pseudo elements and their styling together at its core.
</Card>
<Card title="Tools & Libraries" icon="pen">
As you dig deeper into View Transitions, you will quickly see how a little JavaScript here and there can unlock much more and make things even more fun. 

You do not have to build everything yourself. The Bag provides battle tested libraries and tools that make working with View Transitions easier, more enjoyable, and practical for real projects.
</Card>
<Card title="Fun with View Transitions" icon="pen">
A journey told in episodes, starting with simple use cases and moving toward more
advanced applications. 

Along the way, it covers basic setup, image morphing,
fixing broken text transitions, and extended same page examples.
</Card>
<Card title="Tips & Tricks" icon="pen">
What would a bag of tricks be without a few tips and tricks along the way? Everything here comes straight from real world practice, built for real world use. 

I have stumbled through the rough edges, chased down the weird bugs, and made all the mistakes already, so you do not have to.
</Card>
<Card title="Tech Demos" icon="pen">
Last but not least, it is all about "show, don't tell". New techniques are always easier to grasp when you can see them in action instead of just reading about them. 

The Tech Demos section at the end of the navigation links to all the examples, and there are, if I may say so with a bit of modesty, a few real gems in there.
