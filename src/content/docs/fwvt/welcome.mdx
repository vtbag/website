      In this first episode of the series, we'll cover the **essentials to get started** with view transitions for **MPA sites**:

- Enabling cross-document view transitions
- Respecting users' preferences for reduced motion
- Including necessary CSS on all relevant pages
- Waiting for the main content of the page to load

     Taking a closer look behind the scenes to explore how the View Transition API's built-in page transitions work, and how to tweak the default settings:

  - Examining the pseudo-elements involved in view transitions
  - Breaking down the default cross-fade effect
  - Configuring a custom cross-fade
  - Crafting animations that go beyond cross-fades

     - Add `view-transition-name` properties to create additional animations
     - Assign individual animation durations
     - Morph anything into everything
     - Be cautious when morphing small text sections with different content and styling
