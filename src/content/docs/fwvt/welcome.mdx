    Hello, and welcome to _Fun with View Transitions!_

    If you are anything like me, you are excited
    to bring some life and polish to your website. In this little series we are
    diving into the wonderful world of view transitions, where smooth animations
    and fluent page updates can turn your site from _meh_ to _marvelous_.

Whether you're new to view transitions or looking to level up your skills, this series will guide you step by step. If your browser does not support native view transitions (yes, we are looking at you, Firefox ðŸ‘€) this may not be for you.

Through quick, fun exercises, we'll explore how to add some serious visual flair to your web projects. Each episode will break down examples from this site, showing you step-by-step how to recreate them for your own view transition adventures adventures.

So, letâ€™s get started because view transitions are _seriously_ fun!

In this first episode of the series, we'll cover the **essentials to get started** with view transitions for **MPA sites**:

<div>

  - Enabling cross-document view transitions
  - Respecting users' preferences for reduced motion
  - Including necessary CSS on all relevant pages
  - Waiting for the main content of the page to load

</div>

      title="Check and Control the Image Animations!"

      href="/fwvt/customizing/"
      from="January 22, 2025">

     Taking a closer look behind the scenes to explore how the View Transition API's built-in page transitions work, and how to tweak the default settings:

<div>

  - Examining the pseudo-elements involved in view transitions
  - Breaking down the default cross-fade effect
  - Configuring a custom cross-fade
  - Crafting animations that go beyond cross-fades

</div>

      description="Today we add these morphing animations the View Transition API is famous for!"

      from="January 25, 2025"
    >


     Time to add those iconic morph animations the View Transition API is famous for!

     - Add `view-transition-name` properties to create additional animations
     - Assign individual animation durations
     - Morph anything into everything
     - Be cautious when morphing small text sections with different content and styling
