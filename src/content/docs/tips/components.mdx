Let's assume you define a component like

If you're accustomed to building with components, you want to use startViewTransition

it might not always be clear which page a component will end up on and where the corresponding CSS should be placed. Additionally, the requirement that `view-transition-name` values must be unique on a page makes you reconsider whether it's wise to hardcode view transition names inside reusable components. Especially if you craft a component that can end up with multiple copies on the same page. This is very similar to how to handle `id` attributes.

After a phase of experimentation and trying out different approaches, my suggestion for componentized view transition is this:

1. Plan for [scoped view transitions](/basics/javascript/#scoped-view-transitions). This will be a big leap for componentized same-document view transitions once they are widely supported by major browsers.

2. The next best thing to scoped view transitions for componentization is to make sure that view transition names for an view transition use case only exist when that transition gets triggered.

        Elements without view transition names
        You need JavaScript to start call startViewTransition. So you


set a individual view transition **type** when calling `startViewTransition()` and use this to scope individual same-document view transitions. This type will be active right before the old images are identified until right after the last animation of a view transition pseudo element ends.  The idea is to
