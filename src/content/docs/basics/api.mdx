title: The View Transition API
description: Basics information about the View Transition browser API
---

The View Transition API is a rather new API. Eventually, this site will hold more background  information about the API.

I made a start with &hellip;
* &hellip; information about the [structure of the pseudo-elements](/basics/pseudos/) of the API
* &hellip; and about the [mechanisms of the default animations](/basics/default-animations/).
* Recently I also added some background on [how to style view transitions](/basics/styling/).

While I add more pages, I'm also happy that I can offer some links to previous work on the `astro-vtbot` package[^1].

* An [Overview](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/) and a [Details](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/details/) article on the API
* An in depth [same-document example](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/example/)
