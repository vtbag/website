The View Transition API is a rather new API. In this section you can find&hellip;

* &hellip;some [basic examples](/basics/examples/) of same-document and cross document view transitions.
* &hellip;information about the [structure of the pseudo-elements](/basics/pseudos/) of the API.
* &hellip;and about the [mechanisms of the default animations](/basics/default-animations/).
* &hellip;some background on [how to style view transitions](/basics/styling/).
* &hellip;details on how to use the [JavaScript API](/basics/javascript/) for same-document view transitions.
* &hellip;all there is to know about the [stacking behavior](/basics/hide-and-seek/) of view transitions.

While I add more pages, I'm also happy that I can offer some links to previous work on the [`astro-vtbot` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-vtbot):

* An [Overview](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/) and a [Details](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/details/) article on the API
* An in depth [same-document example](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/example/)

#### Recent Changes

|When|What|Where|
|---|---|---|
|2025-10-17|The view transition object offers a [`waitUntil()`](/basics/javascript/#waituntil) function that can be called with a promise. Now the view transitions `finished` promise does not only wait for the animations on pseudo-elements to end, but also waits for all promises passed via `waitUntil()` to settle.|[Level 2, waitUntil](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#dom-viewtransition-waituntil)| 
|2025-10-02|[Scoped view transitions](/basics/javascript/#scoped-view-transitions), where `startViewTransition()` can be called on DOM elements. To distinguish (element-)scoped view transitions from what we had before, cross-document view transitions and view transitions started with `document.startViewTransition()` might also be called _global_ view transitions.|[Level 2, Scoped View Transitions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#scoped-vt)
|2025-10-02| The [`transitionRoot`](/basics/javascript/#transitionroot) property of the view transition object returns the root element of a scoped view transition. For a global view transition it returns the `documentElement`|[Level 2, transitionRoot](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#dom-viewtransition-transitionroot)|
|2025-10-02|The new value `view-transition` for the `contain` property ensures that view transition names are not visible outside a subtree|[Level 2, View Transition Name Isolation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#contain-view-transition)|
|2025-08-25|Expose the currently active view transition object as [`activeViewTransition`](/basics/javascript/#checking-for-an-active-view-transition) on the document, or on an element for scoped view transitions.| [Level 2, Exposing current transition](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#active-view-transition)  | 
|2025-06-18| The `old`, `new`, and `image-pair` pseudos now also [inherit](/basics/styling/#inherited-animation-properties) the timing function, iteration count, direction, play state animation properties.|[Level 1, User Agent Styles](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-1/#ua-styles)
|2025-06-16| Nested view transition groups are children of a new pseudo-element, which is the sibling of the image pair. The border width of this [`::view-transition-group-children()`](/basics/pseudos/#nested-view-transition-groups) pseudo-element gets automatically copied over from the original element.|[Level 2, Group Children](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#view-transition-group-children-pseudo)|
|2025-03-24| Change to [`view-transition-name: auto`](/basics/pseudos/#auto-generated-names-auto) when the element has an id property: Instead of using the id as view transition name, now generates a random name like match-element. |[Level 2, View Transition Name](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#additions-to-vt-name) |
|2025-02-20| Added [`view-transition-name: match-element;`](/basics/pseudos/#auto-generated-names-match-element) for automatically assigning element specific view transition names.|[Level 2, View Transition Name](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#additions-to-vt-name)|

#### Upcoming Topics

These may or may not make it into the spec.

|When|What|Where|
|---|---|---|
|2025-09-18|Support two phases for cross-document view transitions: instead of waiting for enough content of the new page to load before starting animations, begin them on the old page by hopping through a quickly computable preview state for a smoother user experience. |[Explainer: Two-phase view transition](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/css-view-transitions-2/two-phase-transition-explainer.md)
|2025-08-20|Allow the view transition pseudo-elements inside the :has() pseudo-class.|[#12630](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12630)| 
|2025-08-05|Introduce DOM nodes as proxies to pseudo-elements. This would for example allow us to define an event listener for `::view-transition-new(button)` using such a proxy.|[#12575](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12575)|
|2025-06-18| Also copy border radius and corner shape form old and new original elements and animate the `::view-transition-group-children()` from old to new values.|[#12357](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12357), [#12363](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12363)  |
|2025-05-28|User defined view transition names must not start with `-ua-` as those are reserved for the user agent, e.g. for `match-element` and `auto`.|[#12241](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12241) |
|2025-01-29| `::view-transition-new(*) { pointer-events: auto }` to forward pointer events from the pseudo-element to the original element.|[#11596](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11596) |
2024-06-13| `transitionRoot` property of the `ViewTransition` object reports the DOM element the scoped view transition was called on.|[comment on #9908](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9908#issuecomment-2165621635)|
