description: How to interact with view transitions from JavaScript
---

Browser-native cross-document view transitions can be implemented entirely in CSS without JavaScript. However, JavaScript becomes essential for advanced functionality, such as
- starting same-page view transitions with `startViewTransition()`,
- programmatically modifying CSS properties like `view-transition-name`,
- setting view transition types,
- or running code when transitions start or finish.


## Same-Document View Transitions
For a detailed guide on the API and the processing of same-document view transitions, refer to the[vtbot site](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/details/).

## Cross-Document View Transitions

Cross-document view transitions work similarly to same-document ones but are triggered by navigation. Two key events enable JavaScript interaction: `pageswap`, dispatched just before leaving the old page, and pagereveal, dispatched before the new page renders.

Both events include a `viewTransition` property, which holds a `ViewTransition` object if the transition is part of a cross-document view transition. For `pagereveal`, when `viewTransition` is defined, its `updateCallbackDone` promise is immediately settled.

The events allow you to manipulate the DOM or CSS properties right before snapshots are taken or the new page's live images are captured. In particular, they allow for [setting view transition types](/basics/styling/#-with-types) for the current view transition.

In a `pageswap` listener, you can define view transition types by adding them to `event.viewTransition.types`, which are then only applied to the old page. The types can be used to [control via CSS](/tools/turn-signal/#switching-transition-names) what view transition names are defined on the old page. You can also directly modify view transition names in the listener as snapshots for the `::view-transition-old` pseudo elements are not taken taken before this event is dispatched.

Similarly, `pagereveal` listeners allow you to tweak view transition names and types for the new page. Again, live images for the `::view-transition-new` pseudo-elements are being captured after the event.


The `pageswap` event also provides a `NavigationActivation` object via its `activation` property, offering details about the current page (`from`) and next page (`entry`). While the `pagereveal` event does not include this property, in browsers supporting the Navigation API, you can use `navigation.activation` to access information about the previous page (`from`) and current page (`entry`).
